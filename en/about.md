# Hello, I'm Qiyang

I'm currently working as an iOS developer, primarily using Swift / SwiftUI, and also exploring TypeScript, React, and other frontend technologies.

For me, programming is not just a job, but a way of creation: solving problems, implementing ideas, and making tools truly serve people.

## Tech Stack

- iOS Development (Swift / SwiftUI)
- Frontend Exploration (TypeScript / React)
- Tools and efficiency improvement related tinkering

## Interests & Daily Life

Outside of work, I enjoy reading, writing, and occasionally looking up at the stars at night.

I occasionally try to record some thoughts and essays: the parts beyond technology, perhaps leaving some traces in the lines of words.

## About This Site

This blog serves both as a notebook and a personal space: on one hand, organizing technical insights, and on the other, sharing some personal thoughts and observations.

I hope to provide readers with some inspiration, or at least leave them with a pleasant reading experience.
